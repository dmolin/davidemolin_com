davidemolin.com Website, using Next and Tailwind CSS
==========================================================================

The website is live [here](http://davidemolin.com)

This project is phasing out the old MeteorJS version (you can find it [here](https://github.com/dmolin/davidemolin_meteor)) and adopting NextJS.

It's still in the making and I'm still working on it so don't expect much. in my TODO list:

- Rewrite in Typescript
- Move the fixture data in a DB and use Apollo Client to fetch data

### Technologies Used ###

- Next 12
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
